# Evaluating Applications

The People Portal provides a set of tools to help you review, track, and manage candidates throughout the hiring lifecycle.

## The Kanban Board

The **Applications** tab features a Kanban board for visual candidate management. Applications move through the following stages:

*   **Applied:** New applications land here.
*   **Interview:** Candidates selected for an interview.
*   **Potential Hire:** Strong candidates being considered for an offer.
*   **Hired:** Finalized team members.
*   **Rejected:** Candidates who were not selected.

### Moving Candidates
*   **Drag & Drop:** Simply drag a candidate card from one column to another to update their stage.
*   **Stage Rules:** The system enforces logical transitions to ensure process integrity (e.g., typically you can't move someone directly from "Applied" to "Hired" without an interview step).

### Notifications
When you change a candidate's stage, they will receive an automated email notification (e.g., inviting them to an interview, sending an onboarding link, or a rejection notice).

## Reviewing Candidates

Click on any candidate card to open the **Application Details** modal.

### Application Info
*   **Profile & Resume:** View their contact info, external links, and download their resume securely.
*   **Responses:** Read their answers to general and role-specific questions.
*   **Role Preferences:** See which roles they ranked highest if they applied for multiple positions.

### Feedback & Ratings
*   **Star Rating:** Rate candidates on a 5-star scale. This is useful for quick sorting and prioritizing candidates in the pipeline.
*   **Notes:** Add internal notes or interview feedback.
    *   Notes support markdown formatting.
    *   Each note is automatically stamped with the author's name and a timestamp, creating a transparent history of team feedback.

## Recruitment Statistics

The **Statistics** tab provides insights into your hiring funnel. It shows the number of applicants at each stage and breakdowns per role, helping you identify:
*   Which roles receive the most interest.
*   Where candidates are dropping off in the pipeline.
*   Overall volume of applications to manage.
