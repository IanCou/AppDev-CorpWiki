# Recruitment Overview

The Recruitment module in the People Portal (ATS) provides a streamlined workflow for teams to manage their hiring process effectively.

## Benefits for Teams

*   **Centralized Management:** Handle all applications in one place.
*   **Customizable Workflow:** Define the specific roles you need and ask questions for specific roles.
*   **Visual Pipeline:** Use the Kanban board to efficiently visualize the recruitment process.
*   **Collaborative Hiring:** Share applications, feedback, and notes across project leadership.

## Recruitment Workflow

The system is designed around two main activities:

### 1. [Posting Roles](./posting-roles.md)
Set up your team for success by defining clear roles and requirements. This section covers enabling recruitment, creating role badges, and setting up targeted questions to filter for the best candidates.

### 2. [Evaluating Applications](./evaluating-applications.md)
Once applications start rolling in, use the management tools to review profiles, rate candidates, move them through the application stages, and make hiring decisions.
