# Posting Roles

Before you can start accepting applications, you need to configure your recruitment settings to let applicants know what you are looking for.

## Configuration

Navigate to the **"Recruitment Settings"** tab in your Team Dashboard to access these controls.

### Enable Recruitment
Toggle the **"Enable Recruiting"** switch for the specific subteam you want to hire for.
*   **What this does:** This makes your team visible on the public Open Roles page.
*   **Note:** You can toggle this off at any time to pause applications without losing your configuration.

### Define Roles
List the specific positions you are hiring for in that subteam (e.g., "Frontend Engineer", "Marketing Lead").
*   Enter a role name and press Enter to add it.
*   **Visibility:** These roles will appear as badges on your team card and as options for applicants to select in their application.

### Role-Specific Questions
Once you've added roles, you can define specific questions for each one.
*   **Usage:** This is useful for gathering targeted information (e.g., "Link to your portfolio" for designers).
*   **Applicant View:** Applicants will only see questions relevant to the roles they select.
