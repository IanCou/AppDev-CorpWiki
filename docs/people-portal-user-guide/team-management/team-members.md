# Team Members

This page covers how to manage team members and permissions.

:::info
A user can be a member of multiple teams, but they can only belong to **one subteam per team**. For example, a user can be on both a Robotics Project Team and the Sponsorship Corporate Team, but cannot be on both the Leadership and Engineering subteams of the Robotics Project. 
:::

Managing who can access your Project Team is done through the **Who's on my Team?** tab on your Team Dashboard. The members are sorted by **subteam**.

## Adding New Members

There are three primary ways to add people to your Project Team.

### Adding Existing Members
If the person is already a member of App Dev (they have a People Portal account):
1. Go to your team's **Dashboard**.
2. Click **Add Member** at the top right.
3. Search for their name or email.
4. Assign them a **Subteam** and a **Role**.

### Hiring through Recruitment
The most common way to add new members is through the recruitment process.

### Inviting External Members
:::danger Recruitment Override Warning
By directly adding a member, you're bypassing App Dev's standard recruitment procedures. Please use this feature only if you are entirely sure that this person would be a great fit for the team and that they would align with App Dev's culture and standards.
:::

If you need to add someone brand new to App Dev *without* them going through a public application:
1. Click **Add Member** on your team's dashboard and select the **Invite Member** tab.
2. Enter their name and their **@terpmail.umd.edu** email address.
3. Select their initial **Subteam** and **Role**.
4. They will receive an email with a unique link to join the organization and your team.

## Removing Members

To remove a member from a team:
1. Go to the **Team Dashboard** and look at the **"Who's on my Team"** section.
2. Find the user in list and click the **Trash** icon.
