# Subteam Settings

Subteams represent specific working groups within your Project Team. This page covers how to create and manage these subteams.

![Subteams List View](/img/people-portal/Subteams.png) 

## The Default Subteams

When a Project Team is first created, the People Portal automatically generates two core subteams:

- **Leadership**: Typically used for Project Leads and management.
- **Engineering**: Used for the primary development team.

You can add more subteams as needed to organize your project (e.g., "Design," "Marketing," or "Mobile").

## Creating a Subteam

To add a new subteam to your Project Team:

1. Navigate to **Organization > Teams**.
2. Select your **Project Team**.
3. In the **Subteams** section, click the **"+" (Plus)** button.
4. Enter a **Subteam Name** and **Description**.


## Editing a Subteam

To change the details of an existing subteam:

1. Click on the **Manage Subteams** button on the Team Dashboard.
2. Click on the specific subteam on the left that you want to edit.
3. Click on the **pencil icon** next to the subteam name at the top.
4. Update the name or description as needed.

:::warning Important: Subteam Name vs. Shared Resource ID
Just like the Main Team, each subteam has its own **Shared Resource ID** generated when it is created.

**Editing the Subteam Name does NOT change the Shared Resource ID.**

If your subteam is integrated with external services, renaming it will not update those resources:

- **Slack Channels**: The names of existing Slack channels associated with the subteam will **not** change.

This ensures that communication links and integrations remain stable even if the subteam's display name is updated.
