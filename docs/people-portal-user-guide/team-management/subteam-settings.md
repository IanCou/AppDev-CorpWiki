# Subteam Settings

Subteams represent specific working groups within your Project Team. This page covers how to create and manage these subteams.

:::warning Important: Subteam Name vs. Shared Resource ID
Just like the Main Team, each subteam has its own **Shared Resource ID** generated when it is created.

**Editing the Subteam Name does NOT change the Shared Resource ID.**

If your subteam is integrated with external services, renaming it will not update those resources:

- **Slack Channels**: The names of existing Slack channels associated with the subteam will **not** change.

This ensures that communication links and integrations remain stable even if the subteam's display name is updated.
