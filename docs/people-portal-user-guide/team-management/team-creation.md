# Team Creation

This page covers how to create new teams in the People Portal.

## Creating a Team

To begin, navigate to **Organization > Teams** in the left sidebar. On the top right, click **Create Team**.

A dialog will appear where you must enter the following details:

### Team Details

- **`Team Name`**: Enter a descriptive name for the team. Include the company that the contract is for, if applicable.
  > **Note:** Do not include the timeframe (e.g., "Fall 2025") in the name as this is selected separately.

- **`Team Description`**: Describe the goal of the team. Details you can include but are not limited to the project scope, tech stack, and key deliverables or milestones.

- **`Team Type`**: There are three types of teams that can be created:
  - **Project Team**: Standard teams working on specific projects or contracts.
  - **Bootcamp Team**: Educational teams for bootcamps such as Web Dev or Quantum.
  - **Corporate Team**: Internal teams for App Dev Operations (e.g., Sponsorship, Marketing).

- **`Team Season`**: Select the appropriate semester (e.g., Fall, Spring) and year from the dropdowns.

Once all details are entered, click **Create Team**.
