# Team Creation

This page covers how to create new teams in the People Portal.

:::warning Automatic Configuration
When a new team is created, necessary **subteams** are automatically generated. These subteams come with **default permissions** that are automatically assigned to any members you add to them. You can edit these permissions after team creation.
:::

:::info Permissions & Approval
**Who can create teams?**
Users with **Admin** or **Executive** permissions can create teams directly.

If you do not have these permissions, clicking "Create Team" will submit a **Team Request**. The executive team will review your request, and you will receive email updates regarding its approval status.

To begin, navigate to **Organization > Teams** in the left sidebar. On the top right, click **Create New Team**.

A dialog will appear where you must enter the following details:

### Team Details

- **Team Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the team. Include the company that the contract is for, if applicable.
  > **Note:** Do not include the timeframe (e.g., "Fall 2025") in the name as this is selected separately.
