# Correction of Error (COE)

Correction of Error is a process for improving quality by documenting and addressing issues. You will want to define a standardized way to document critical root causes, and ensure they are reviewed and addressed.

## Overview

Applying a COE process helps you ensure your team understands root causes, that they have been reviewed in a consistent way, and have been addressed correctly.

## Structure of a COE

A well-structured COE should answer the following questions:

1. **What happened?**
2. **What was the impact on customers and your business?**
3. **What was the root cause?**
4. **What data do you have to support this?**
   - Provide metrics and graphs.
5. **What were the critical pillar implications, especially security?**
   - When architecting workloads you make trade-offs between pillars based upon your business context. These business decisions can drive your engineering priorities.
   - You might optimize to reduce cost at the expense of reliability in development environments, or, for mission-critical solutions, you might optimize reliability with increased costs.
6. **What lessons did you learn?**
7. **What corrective actions are you taking?**
   - Action items
   - Related items (trouble tickets, etc.)

## Review Process

You should have your COE reviewed by your team, as well as other teams.

- **High impact COEs**: Should be reviewed during your operational meetings.
- **The Wheel**: Use the iterative nature of the COE process to continuously improve.
