# Executive Authorization Layer

The Executive Authorization Layer is a core authorization system which provides the highest level of resource access and manipulation within People Portal. It overrides all the enforcements from the Bindle Authorization Layer and provides the ability to modify special resources like, Team Creation, Executive Board Manipulation and the ability to create an authoritative team if the user is a Superuser.
